# X-Team 18 Rules

These rules establish how our team will assign tasks,
track progress on each task, and communicate with each other 
when a member is unable to complete a task that has been assigned to that member.

This document helps individual members understand the team's expectations,
and will hopefully lead to productive team work with fewer conflicts
and missed deadlines.

## How we will assign (and reassign) tasks
We'll assign tasks after discussing them in our group chat.
The work will be divided closely equally, to make sure everyone contributes some amount.
The project manager will assign tasks and take into account team member's available time.

## How will we track progress (and follow-up) on completion of tasks
We will check whether the last person completed his task before starting a new task. 
We will also check in on progress via group chat during the halfway point to the deadline.
Additionally we will guage the difficulty of each task accordingly to delegate each task as best we can.

## How will we communicate difficulties with a task assigned to us
If issues arise, we will discuss it in our group chat or meet in person.
If someone can't handle a certain task because of time constraints or other issues, we will delegate it to another member.
Certain difficulties may require greater collaboration on specific tasks.

## How we will back up each other to ensure that deadlines are not missed
We will also check in on progress via group chat during the halfway point to the deadline.
The day before the deadline, we will submit, so that we have an extra day to check over our work.
If a deadline is closing in without much progress made, we will meet up and consult with a TA.
